		<h4>Frustrated with no or slow weight loss?</h4>
		<p>When attempting to lose weight, many people will run in to the dreaded "plateau". What causes this? Has your body adapted? Are you in "starvation-mode"? Hint: "starvation-mode" doesn't exist in the way that you think it does.</p>
		<h5>So, what's going on? Why has the weight loss stopped?</h5>
		<p>Almost without fail, what happens when a diet stops working is that you have stopped working the diet. When you first start a diet, you have fresh determiniation, a drive to succeed. It's exciting following the diet rules
			and seeing the scale move every week. After a while, though, things start slipping. Maybe you miss tracking a few bites of food here or there or you start treating yourself more. Maybe you start "cheating" more regularly. 
			There are a number of ways to sabotage your efforts, and they all lead to the same result - FRUSTRATION.
		</p>
		<h5>So, what do you do? Are you doomed to be stuck forever?</h5>
		<p>If you find that you are at a plateau or find that you are frustrated with slower than expected weight loss, try committing to being accurate in monitoring your diet. If you haven't been keeping a food journal, 
			start tracking your intake. If you've been tracking your intake, make sure you track everything, every single day. If you're tracking everything and you are still not seeing the results you expect, try measuring your food for a while. 
			Using measuring cups and spoons is better than not measuring at all, but the most accurate way to measure your food is to use a food scale. It may sound extreme to use a scale to measure your food intake, however it's actually quite simple, 
			easier even than using cups and spoons.

		<h4>If you're still doubtful about the importance of tracking your food and using a food scale, check out this video. It highlights how easy it is to understimate your intake, even when you are actively tracking.</h4>
